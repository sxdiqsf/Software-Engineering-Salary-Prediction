Learning Methodology and
Algorithm
We will use supervised learning
methodology to train our model on the
dataset.
We will use the Random Forest Regressor
algorithm, which is an ensemble learning
method for regression that operates by
constructing a multitude of decision trees
at training time and outputting the mean
prediction of the individual trees.
